Amid a string of lackluster horror movies hitting theaters, _Hereditary_ was released. It became the next big thing, a revolutionary horror movie that chronicled the Graham family's misfortunes following their reclusive grandmother’s recent passing. And although it tries to rejuvenate a cliched story seen in every blockbuster horror film, there is one major issue — _it sucks_.


_Hereditary_ received critical acclaim, with an 89% rating from movie critics on Rotten Tomatoes and positive reviews from viewers alike. For a horror movie following the overused familial demonic ties to full-on possession, it provided a somewhat rich, refreshing storyline. But even though director Ari Aster tried his hardest to provide a new take to an old story, it fell short. And don’t get me wrong; I have seen nearly every cheesy horror movie from the last two decades, but the fact that Hereditary evaded this criticism baffles me. To me, the only worthwhile scene was the grotesque moment when Charlie, the youngest of the Graham family, is decapitated on the way back from a party. Even so, as much as Aster tried, adding a few minor twists and horrific scenes does not compensate for everything that the movie lacks. So why did top critics, like Dan Tabor, love the movie so much?

> Hereditary is a super effective slow burn shocker, a perfect blend of art house sensibilities and transgressive surreal horror that coalesces into a modern classic of the genre.

— _Dan Tabor, Phawker_

At its core, _Hereditary_ is the traditional “family-meets-demonic possession” storyline. Although Hereditary contains its share of worthwhile, shocking moments, it fails to avoid the storyline’s clunky trajectory: an average family unearthing demonic ties and ending up with everyone dead. _Hereditary_ tries to overcompensate this drawback with masterfully executed scenes: the mother crawling on the ceiling, the son smashing his face repeatedly into his desk at school, or the dead grandmother’s body mysteriously reappearing at the end. Much of its praise comes from cinematography, and although it looks pretty, the movie still relies on an outdated story that just doesn’t cut it anymore. In a world where you can find real horrifying news on the internet, we are desensitized to many forms of horror. Pairing this with an outdated storyline, _Hereditary_ and similar films lose their effectiveness in actually invoking horror.


Maybe you think the storyline wasn’t that bad. Sure, my criticism may appear harsh, especially coming from a horror movie fan. But there is another major flaw that overshadows the movie’s redeeming qualities:  the acting.  These criticisms are mostly directed at Alex Wolff and Toni Collette, who play Peter and Annie Graham in the film, but Peter’s take on an angsty, broody teenager was especially painful to watch. The stomping around and sulking, the consistently apathetic reaction to everything that happened (yes — even when he decapitated his sister), and the loner-boy aesthetic was just poorly executed. It may encapsulate how a teenager feels, but Wolff's acting ultimately falls short of presenting it in a meaningful way. And when you rely on someone like Wolff to drive the story along, it results in awkward moments that leave viewers uncomfortable in all the wrong ways.


Considering Wolff's and Collette’s acting with certain scenes, _Hereditary_ falls flat. Take when Charlie asks to go to the party with Peter, a scene that highlights interactions between the whole family. Even with Charlie and the parents' dynamic performances, it’s challenging to shake the notion that it is not just a room of actors reading lines from a script because of Wolff. Horror movies need to be _immersive_, and Hereditary was unable to do that throughout the film. Or in the séance scene with Collette, it appears as if she is unable to fully immerse herself into the character. The constant gasps and sporadic screaming, paired with the painfully forced expressions, break the dramatic mood. The movie’s attempt to provide an actual shocking moment fell flat in its acting.


_Hereditary_ was the talk of the cinematic world, bringing in countless awards for its precision and breathtaking story. Everyone couldn’t believe the sick, twisted storyline and the Graham family’s ultimate demise. But despite the sophisticated cinematography, no one questioned why a movie with so many drawbacks won so many awards and high praise.   _Hereditary_  fails   to   provide   any   worthwhile and memorable moments and falls short of what it could have been, regardless of whether you like horror movies or not.
