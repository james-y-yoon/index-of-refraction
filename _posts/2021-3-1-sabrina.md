Like many other fans of paranormal and supernatural series, I was extremely thrilled at the adaptation of _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_ into a more contemporary take with _The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina_ (CAOS). The adaptation centers around Sabrina Spellman and her dual identity as a half-witch, half-mortal. As we quickly learn, the protagonist is very much the “chosen one” to save witches and humans alike.  While the series is promoted as progressive,  the reality is it continues to uphold white exceptionalism in the disguise of inclusive social commentary and cast. 



Sabrina’s character emphasizes the social phenomenon of a white savior. In the first few episodes, the audience gets to know Sabrina, a young teenager balancing school, a relationship, friends, and family (her aunts and warlock cousin raised her since her parents passed in a fatal accident). Immediately, Sabrina is painted as an all-glorified character to self-appoint herself as the heroine for all the troubles in her hometown Greendale. In line with their “girl power” motto, CAOS goes as far as Sabrina fighting for Women’s Intersectional Cultural and Creative Association after football players bully her genderqueer friend. And sure, the series has moments where it highlights inclusivity for nonwhite and queer characters. Still, after five minutes, the storyline always goes back to depicting Sabrina as the savior of all. As Sabrina continues to wreak chaos around her and then solve it, the two biracial but visibly Black female characters get pushed into the margins. 



Like other series, CAOS follows the trope of casting a Black best friend for the white female lead, as it caters mostly to white audiences. Our first introduction to Sabrina’s friends is through Rosalind “Roz” Walker, a clever, radical Black girl. Yet, we don’t learn much about Roz’s background in the first few episodes other than that she is the supporting best friend. As the series progresses, CAOS exploits this character to the point where we only know about her suffering rather than any substantial backstory. As season one progresses, Roz becomes blind, a curse placed by witches on the women in her family — an instance where her character is further minimized to highlight the white witches. This storyline becomes the center of Roz’s character when other white characters  get an  intimate  portrayal of  their family histories.

CAOS’s denial of Roz’s family history, being Black people in the United States, is an erasure to Black people’s enslavement.[^1] CAOS shied away from these difficult and uncomfortable realities when witchcraft would have been a powerful vehicle to highlight history.


Another disturbing moment of this series’s failed attempt to highlight “girl power” is through Prudence. Head witch of the Academy of the Unseen Arts and leader of the “Weird Sisters,” a mean girl group at the witch academy, Prudence is characterized as the evil, dark     witch. Our introduction to Prudence is when she hexes Sabrina, playing on the stereotype of Black women as white women’s aggressors. The power dynamic between the two characters is further complicated when Sabrina is newly admitted into the Academy of the Unseen Arts and is undergoing a hazing ritual called “The Harrowing.” After a series of tricks and trials, the ultimate hazing event is supposed to occur; Sabrina must survive being hung. Sabrina calls on the spirits of dead witches and warlocks to help her get revenge on the Weird Sisters. However, her idea of revenge is hanging them with a noose. A white woman hanging a Black woman is exceptionally problematic for reasons I do not have to mention. Prudence is reduced to a villain and stereotype when her character is extremely complex and a fan favorite. 



Writers and producers alike need to do better. Our current political and social landscape is shifting to recognize and celebrate marginalized voices. Television series like CAOS take pride in their diversity only to monetize on a performative platform with no real substance or change. Plenty of [television series](https://www.bustle.com/p/17-tv-shows-that-will-make-you-a-better-intersectional-feminist-55512) have deep, well-written nonwhite characters that set an example for intricate plotlines about their identities and the series. With its last season already aired, CAOS does not have the opportunity to mend its wrongdoings. Hopefully, the writers and producers learn from their mistakes and develop well-thought-out nonwhite characters and storylines in the future. 

[^1]: Some might say that the blindness is a correlation to the erasure of Black stories. Because of the limitations of this article and the existing scholarship on this topic, I will only focus on how it relates to the minimization of Roz’s character.
