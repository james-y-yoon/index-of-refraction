The index of refraction determines the speed of light in physical media. As light travels between media with different indices, it bends; in a prism, the beams separate into a vibrant rainbow. In society, however, the cultural media that we consume shapes our thoughts. We’re passionate about the media landscape and its cultural and social effects. We believe that the art and entertainment we consume and produce reflects the complex and diverse world around us. Naturally, our anthology collects a broad spectrum of pieces about art and media.

Index of Refraction is a collection of personal essays, criticism pieces, and commentary on various genres of media, including books, films, television shows, and music. We asked for deep and unique analyses on popular entertainment artifacts that seek to bridge the gap between their original purposes and their effects on current events, politics, race, and society. These pieces analyze specific media artifacts in conjunction with the world around it to critique, praise, or both. We also looked for criticism of well-received releases from a contemporary cultural perspective.

In an era where millions of albums, shows, and films are just a click of a button away, media and reality are more intertwined than ever. However, the opposite is true: through social media and technology, we have a greater say in the cultural landscape than ever before. As technology encroaches on reality, it is more important than ever to think critically about art and entertainment we consume. How do artists portray messages through cinematography, music, or writing? How does our backgrounds and identities affect how we interpret digital media? What role does art and media play in initiating social change? 

This anthology includes pieces that feature analyses of social phenomena and thoughtful narrative deep-dives, including a criticism of Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit and a cross-remake comparison of Anne of Green Gables. We hope you enjoy reading this anthology as much as we enjoyed compiling it.

<b>NOTE:</b> Submissions to this anthology contain spoilers of the media pieces they are critiquing. Please be aware of this if you have not watched, read, or listened to the content.
